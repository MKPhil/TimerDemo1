Timer app that shows how long you've used the PC that day

Requirements / Features:
* Always on top
* Drag window to move
* Shows icon in Notification Area, not Taskbar
* Double-click icon in Notification Area to hide, double-click again to show
* Cannot close! No menu or close button, no Alt-F4! Can only be killed by Task Manager
* Timer pauses if the user logs out, uses Switch User, on Hibernate, Sleep.  Restarts on resume
* Zero-footprint - Doesn't store anything on local file system or in the registry
* Resets each day or at 00:00:00 if you're logged on then!

Caveats:
* If user logs off and on again the timer resets (i.e. doesn't remember the earlier session)
* Cannot change colours, window size
